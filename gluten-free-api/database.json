      "name": "Healthy Lemon Bars",
      "ingredients": "Produce 1 tsp Lemon, zest Refrigerated 3 Eggs + 1 egg yolk Condiments 3/4 cup Lemon juice, fresh squeezed 3/4 cup Maple syrup Baking & Spices 1 1/2 cups Almond flour 5/16 cup Coconut flour 1/4 tsp Salt 1 tsp Vanilla Oils & Vinegars 1/3 cup Coconut oil",
      "directions": "1.    Preheat oven 350F.  2.     Make the crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the almond flour, coconut flour, tapioca flour, and sea salt. Add the maple syrup, ghee, and vanilla to the bowl, and fold everything together until a dough forms. Press the crust into the bottom of the prepared pan and bake for 12 minutes.  3.     Make the Filling: While the crust bakes, make the filling. Add the eggs, lemon juice, maple syrup, and lemon zest to a large bowl and whisk well by hand. Don‚Äôt use a mixer for this, as whisking by hand is the best way to fully incorporate the eggs. Whisk quickly until you don‚Äôt see any egg white remaining. Add the tapioca flour and whisk until there are no clumps. Once the crust has finished baking, remove it from the oven. Immediately add the filling. Do not allow the crust to cool.  4.     Bake the Bars: Lower the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit and return the bars to the oven to bake for 20-22 minutes, or until the filling is set. A little jiggle in the center is just right!  5.    Chill: Allow the bars to cool completely, then transfer the pan to the refrigerator for 3-4 hours to let the bars set. Before serving, cut into twelve squares and sprinkle the bars with powdered sugar. Enjoy!",
